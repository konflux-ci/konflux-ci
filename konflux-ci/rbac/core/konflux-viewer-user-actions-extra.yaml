# This ClusterRole extends `konflux-viewer-user-actions` with permissions
# on `projctl` resources.
# 
# As these CustomResources are not installed as part of `konflux-ci/konflux-ci`,
# this ClusterRole will be eventually removed.
# The only purpose of this ClusterRole is to allow anyone relying on these
# permissions to migrate.
