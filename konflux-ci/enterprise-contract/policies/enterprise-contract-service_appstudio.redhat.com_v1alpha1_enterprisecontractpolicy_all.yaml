  description: Include every rule in the default policy source. For experiments only.
    This is not expected to pass for Konflux builds without excluding some rules.
    Available collections are defined in https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.stonesoup.io/ec-policies/release_policy.html#_available_rule_collections.
    If a different policy configuration is desired, this resource can serve as a starting
    point. See the docs on how to include and exclude rules https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.stonesoup.io/ec-policies/policy_configuration.html#_including_and_excluding_rules.
