      This policy applies to pods created for the verify-enterprise-contract task.
      It will reduce the requested cpu and memory resources for all containers created
      by the task to a minimum.
      This is to address a change in the task definition in which the task steps were
      provided with resource requests. This task has many steps, and adding even
      relatively-modest resource requests prevents it from running on setups with
      limited resources, as Tekton creates pods for all steps in a task at the same
      time.
