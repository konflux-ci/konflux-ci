# Org members can trigger E2E runs on any PR by commenting /run.
# One comment = one run of both Operator E2E and Sanity workflows.
#
# How it works:
# - Bot or org member pushes to a PR branch → workflow runs on pull_request_target.
#   check-prerequisites runs, sees PR author is bot/org member → exits 0 → rest of
#   workflow runs (check-changes, then test or test-skip). No comment needed.
# - Non-member pushes → same trigger, but check-prerequisites runs, sees PR author
#   is not bot and not org member → exits 1 → workflow fails there. No later jobs
#   run. To run CI, an org member must comment /run → pr-comment-commands dispatches
#   "e2e" → both workflows run via repository_dispatch (they skip the PR gate).
