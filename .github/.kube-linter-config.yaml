checks:

  # include explicitly adds checks, by name. You can reference any of the built-in checks.
  # Note that customChecks defined above are included automatically.
  include: [ ]
  # exclude explicitly excludes checks, by name. exclude has the highest priority: if a check is
  # in exclude, then it is not considered, even if it is in include as well.
  exclude: [ ]
